Syllabus Statistics Course
__________________________

The idea of this mini course is to give a short overview of statistical
methods that are relatively easy to understand for beginners.
In particular we want to focus on vividness. We would like to tell a story
to biotech students that motivates them to deepen their knowledge in this
field.

Parts of this course are based on the book "Think Stats 2e" by
Allen B. Downey that you can find here:
`https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/`_.
